    description: Enable verbose logging.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean

  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string
    description: |
      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include:

      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed

      For series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * icehouse

      For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * juno
         * kilo
         * ...

      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade.

      NOTE: when openstack-origin-git is specified, OpenStack specific
      packages will be installed from source rather than from the
      openstack-origin repository.
  openstack-origin-git:
    default:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies a YAML-formatted dictionary listing the git

      Note that the installed config files will be determined based on
      the OpenStack release of the openstack-origin option.

      For more details see README.md.

      Space-delimited list of external ports to use for routing of instance
      traffic to the external public network. Valid values are either MAC
      addresses (in which case only MAC addresses for interfaces without an IP

  data-port:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |

      bridge-mappings.
      .
      Ports provided can be the name or MAC address of the interface to be
      added to the bridge. If MAC addresses are used, you may provide multiple
      bridge:mac for the same bridge so as to be able to configure multiple
      units. In this case the charm will run through the provided MAC addresses
      for each bridge until it finds one it can resolve to an interface name.

  instance-mtu:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Configure DHCP services to provide MTU configuration to instances
      within the cloud.  This is useful in deployments where its not
      possible to increase MTU on switches and physical servers to
      accommodate the packet overhead of using GRE tunnels.
  enable-l3-agent:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of linux router

    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in Nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of Nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup

  # Legacy (Icehouse) HA
  ha-legacy-mode:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True will enable Pacemaker to monitor the neutron-ha-monitor daemon
      on every neutron-gateway unit, which detects neutron agents status and
      reschedule resources hosting on failed agents, detects local errors and
      release resources when network is unreachable or do necessary recover
      tasks. This feature targets to < Juno which doesn't natively support HA
      in Neutron itself.

  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
