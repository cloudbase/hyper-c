This is a helper binary pre-compiled for your convenience from [this project](https://github.com/cloudbase/SetUserAccountRights "SetUserAccountRights"). This is used by Grant-Privilege to add privileges to a particular user. Feel free to inspect the code and compile it yourself if you prefer not to use the pre-compiled binary.
