    default: distro
    type: string
    description: |
      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include:

      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed

      For series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * icehouse

      For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * juno
         * kilo
         * ...

      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade.

      NOTE: when openstack-origin-git is specified, openstack specific
      packages will be installed from source rather than from the
      openstack-origin repository.

      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension.

      configured/available on your network interface.

    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
