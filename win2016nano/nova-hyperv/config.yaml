      an md5sum at the end of the URL as follows:

      Enables the Hyper-V compute driver for clustering. This requires at least two Hyper-V compute

  os-data-network:
    type: string
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Data network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24) . This network will be used for tenant network traffic in
      overlay networks.
      NOTE: If ovs is selected as the network type, this option overrides
      data-port. OVS on Windows requires that the os data network be set on the
      vmswitch itself. That means that if an interface has an IP in the os-data-network
      range, that interface will be added to the vmswitch. There is a caveat here.
      If os-data-network is on a different interface then data-port, it might result
      in the hyper-v compute nodes not being able to use VLAN network segregation.

      Ethernet inerface to use for vmswitch. This can be a MAC address or an interface name.
      This option is mandatory if more then one interface is present on the target system.
      In cases where there is only one interface on the system, the vmswitch will be created using that
      interface and OSManagement will be set to True, regardless of the vmswitch-management option.
      Avoid using the management interface as a data interface where system has more then one NIC.
      If you would like to use bonding, make sure you supply valid MAC addresses in the bond-ports
      config field, and use "bond0" as a data-port name.
